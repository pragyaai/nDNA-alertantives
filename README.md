## A research project representing a unified framework combining Spectral Curvature Analysis, Thermodynamics Signature, and Belief Vector Dynamics for evaluating semantic complexity in Transformer based Deep Neural Network(NN) or Large Language Models (LLMs)

# Overview

This comprehensive readme file provides analysis of various LLMs on SQuAD 2.0 dataset. It demonstrates distinct thermodynamic signatures correlating with model performance, alignment properties, and belief formation. Our framework provides the first systematic approach to quantifying information processing complexity in neural architectures with direct implications for AI alignment, capability assessment, and belief system analysis.

# Introduction and Core Framework:

Our unified framework is based on three pillars that establishes three fundamental metrics that collectively characterize the information processing landscape of Deep Neural Network in modern LLMs.<br>

► 1. **_Spectral Curvature_**: Quantifies geometric properties of the parameter manifold <br><br>
► 2. **_Thermodynamic Length_**: Measures information processing complexity via Fisher-Rao distances <br><br>
► 3. **_Belief Vector Dynamics_**: Captures epistemic confidence and uncertainty propagation <br><br>

The **Spectral metrics (αℓ, κℓ)** capture geometry, **thermodynamic length(Lℓ)** captures latent movement, and belief norm quantifies alignment strength of the model.

# Mathematical Foundation:

**Spectral Curvature Analysis (κℓ):**

where 
 s = parameterizes depth through the network. 
 Our discrete (κℓ) provides a practical, layerwise estimator


# Dataset(s)

We have used **SQuAD 2.0** (https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkar/squad_v2) dataset for our experiments and analysis of these metrics.

# Models Evaluated

Throughput our work, we used the following models to proof our hypothesis:

► Llama-3.2-3B<br>
► Qwen2.5<br>
► DeepSeek-R1<br>
► GPT-2<br>
► Mistral-8B<br><br>
